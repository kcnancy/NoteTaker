> Modify starter code to create a an application called NoteTaker that can be used to write, save and delete notes. User will launch application click Get started from the launch page. The notes page will populate with any existing notes on the left side of the page and Note Title and text area are ready to be populated. Once there is information in the new note area the save icon will appear in the upper left corner. Clicking save moves the note to the list on the left side of the page. The new text are wil revert to the "Note Title" ready for another note. If the user clicks on one of the notes in the left column that note will appear in the main body. It can't be modified with this version of this app. The notes on the left can be deleted by clicking on the red trash can icon. To start a new note click on the pencil in the upper right corner.
